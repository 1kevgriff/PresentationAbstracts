#Faster Deployments by Dockerizing ASP.NET Core Applications

Two amazing new technologies are coming into the limelight: ASP.NET Core and Docker.

Docker has provided developers the unique ability to package their applications into small, bite-sized containers that allow for quick delivery to any Docker platform around the world.  Updating one to thousands of nodes can be done within seconds.  

ASP.NET Core is a new, radical approach to the platform we have known and loved for fifteen years.  New changes to ASP.NET Core to focus on cross-platform support has made it a prime target for dockerizing.  

In this presentation, you will learn how to build a simple ASP.NET Core application from the ground up, and deploy it to datacenters around the world with few simple commands.

Learning Objectives:
 - Attendees will learn about Docker, and how Docker containers work
 - Attendees will learn how to create simple applications with ASP.NET Core
 - Attendees will learn how to package an ASP.NET Core application with Docker for deployment
