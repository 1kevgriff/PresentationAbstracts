JavaScript can be a confusing language.  If you are like a lot of developers, you are still trying to learn and adapt to how JavaScript works, and how various libraries such as Angular or React harness it to do pretty cool stuff.  On top of that, the industry is pushing forward with this new thing called ES6 (or EcmaScript).  As much as you would like to resist the change, ES6 is going to be a prevalent part of your toolbox if you are building client-side web applications or server-side node.js application.  In this presentation, you will learn about what ES6 is.  Why do the new features in ES6 help us build better applications?  How do you move from being an "old-school" Javascript developer to being ahead of the curve with ES6? Come prepared for code, discussion, and epiphanies.
