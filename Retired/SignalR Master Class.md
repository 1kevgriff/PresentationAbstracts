Say goodbye to static websites, and say hello to real time applications.  SignalR is a library in the ASP.NET stack that allows you to build fast, efficient real time applications without having to worry about browser and server versions.

Workshop topics will include:

1) Basic Hub and Client Management: Learn how to manage the connection between clients and servers.  How do you do you send messages to particular clients?  
2) Staying Secure: You have a fancy website that is super secure, but how does SignalR fall into this scenario?  
3) Scaling: Most demos show you how amazing SignalR is on a single machine, but never talk about the issue of scaling across multiple machines.  We will cover the simple steps to scale-proofing SignalR.    
4) Managing Performance: You don't have a performance problem until you have a performance problem, and we will learn how to use performance metrics to find bugs in our solutions.  
5) Using SignalR in Non-Web Environments: Why does all the SignalR fun have to be confined to a web app?  We will learn how to use SignalR in self-hosted mode, and how to deploy across non-web clients.
