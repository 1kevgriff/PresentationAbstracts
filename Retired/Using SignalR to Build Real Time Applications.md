In the beginning, we had static websites.  Then we invented AJAX, and our websites became alive with dynamic content.  Now we're getting to a point where we'd like to have our web applications work in cool asynchronous ways across all of it's connected users.  The typically example would be a chat room.  You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room.  In the past, in order to build a system like that took a lot of time and a heaping amount of code. SignalR is a library that assists you in building real-time, multi-user interactive web applications.  In this talk, we'll discuss the current state of the real time web, and then WOW you with quick, easy, and code-filled demos showing off the power of SignalR.
