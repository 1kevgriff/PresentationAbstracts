#So You Want to Build A Web App with node.js

When the majority of people sit down with node.js for the first time, they often want to build some sort of web application.  So how do you do that?  You could always write the JavaScript by hand to directly access sockets, or you could use the HTTP connectors to pre-parse the incoming requests.  Most people will pick up a framework, such as Express.

Over the past two years, I've built a lot of Express applications and have generated several opinions about the best way to structure an application for rapid development.  In this talk, I would like to show you my step-by-step process for building a new Express infrastructure.  We'll cover configuration, file structure,  authentication, and request management from a file and API standpoint.

Come prepared to listen, learn, and discuss!
