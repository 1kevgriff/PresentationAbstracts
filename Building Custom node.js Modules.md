Building Custom node.js Modules
===============================

The growth of node.js can solely be placed on it's community, and their ability to develop modules when a need arises.  Developers constantly see ways they can abstract their code bases out into individual modules, which node.js has fantastic support for.  In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will guide attendees through the process of creating a node module and distributing it in the Node Package Manager central repository.

Learning Objectives
