Robust Web APIs with node.js and Express
========================================

One of the many benefits of using node.js is the ability to quickly build and scale network applications.  One of the best examples for a scalable application is a web server or an API.  For those that might have built APIs in other languages or frameworks, you might find it is often cumbersome and difficult to manage.  In this presentation, attendees will walk through rapidly developing an API with node.js and Express, a modular web framework built on top of node.  Attendees will learn best practices for managing routes and the code that runs behind them.

Learning Objectives
- Attendees will learn about how Express routing works, and how it allows them to quickly create APIs.
- Attendees will learn code organization techniques in node.js to prevent code clutter, and make their APIs easier to work with.
