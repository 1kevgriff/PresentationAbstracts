Robust Web APIs with node.js and Express
========================================

One of the many benefits of using node.js is the ability to quickly build and scale network applications.  One of the best examples for a scalable application is a web server or an API.  In this presentation, attendees will walk through rapidly developing an API with node.js and Express, a modular web framework built on top of node.  

Learning Objectives
- Attendees will learn about how Express routing works, and how it allows them to quickly create APIs.
- Attendees will learn code organization techniques in node.js to prevent code clutter, and make their APIs easier to work with.
