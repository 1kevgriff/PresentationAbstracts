There is a lot of variety in the market for frameworks that assist you in building Single Page Applications.  These can include Backbone, Ember, Durandal, etc.  A framework quickly growing in popularity, and heavily supported by the web teams at Google, is AngularJS.  Angular takes complex ideas such as data binding, routing, and dependency injection, and builds a framework that is easy to work with and understand.  You'll be able to replace several singular frameworks (Knockout, jQuery, etc) with one.  Provide more functionality with less code!   In this presentation, we'll take a real world look at Angular and walk you through several common scenarios.  Come and join us!
