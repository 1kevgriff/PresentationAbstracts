The trend of remote working has been going up over the past several years.  It's a fantastic way to equalize your work life balance, and cut out time wasting activities, such as commuting to an office.

However, working from home can have numerous issues that you would need to identify and resolve in order to be success.  As a dad with three growing boys, I have found working from home to be a continuous challenge.  With my oldest going into 1st grade, my wife and I decided to take the route of homeschooling.  To best set our kids up for success, this meant me moving out of my office over the garage so it could be converted into a homeschooling/play room.  

But where is an office-less dad supposed to go?  Enter the Shedquarters.  With a budget of under $10,000, I successfully created a brand new office for myself in the backyard.  This talk is a postmortem of my experience with the project and will provide guidance to other work from home developers who need something more than a "room in the house".
