# 21st Century Background Services with Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions

How do you handle "background tasks" in your applications? Maybe you build a cronjob or a Windows service to execute some code on a schedule? Maybe you have a background task in your web application?

No matter what you're doing, you are probably building infrastructure to support these background tasks. That can be costly, unreliable, and difficult to debug.

In this presentation, you will be offered an alternative approach to building background services by taking advantage of Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions. You see real-world scenarios that were implemented and that are running right now!


## Outline

1. Title
2. About Me
3. Problem: Worker services for background tasks
    - HangFire (I love HangFire)
    - We don't want to overload web app with background tasks
4. Logic apps can do 99% of the things we need do
    - Databases
    - File stores
    - File reading/writing/manipulation
    - Webhook
5. What is an Azure Logic App?
    - Zapier for developers
    - Non-devs can design workflows
    - Trigger
    - Workflow
    - DEMO: simple logic app
    - Dynamic content / expressions
    - Connectors
        - Reusable across multiple logic apps
        - Hides implementation/security details
6. Managing dependency errors in workflows
7. Scenario 1: Email Processing
    - If statements
    - IDEA: sentiment analysis on email
    - Connectors
8. Scenario 2: Webhook Processing
    - Discourse (as example)
9. Scenario 3: Database/File cleanup
    - For Each conditions
10. Scenario 4: Twitter logging #shedquarters
11. Azure Functions as a Fallback
    - What if ALA doesn't provide functionality?
        - Excel DATETIME
12. Tips
    - Put all logic apps in their own resource groups
        - (cost analysis)
13. Custom Connectors
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-logic-apps-connector

50. Cases Logic apps don't work?
    - Resources intensive processes
    - Regulation/Compliance (health)
    -
