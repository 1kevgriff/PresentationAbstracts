Does every day start the same?  Get up, go to work, work, work, work, come home, do home stuff, go to bed, and repeat.

How would you answer the question: where do you see yourself in 5 years? How about 10 or 25 years?  Is the future brighter? Or grim?

What is your end-game?  Where do you WANT to be in 5, 10, or 25 years from now?  Is the current path you're on leading towards your end-game?  How can you change your course to get you towards your goals?
