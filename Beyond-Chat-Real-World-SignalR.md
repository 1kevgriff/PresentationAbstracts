# Beyond Chat: Real World SignalR

Every. Single. SignalR. Demo. Is. A. Chat. Application.

And that is not a good thing for the platform, because SignalR is far more powerful than our simple demos lead us to believe.  The most common question in intro-level SignalR sessions is "How does this apply in a real world application?"  That is a fantastic question, and the answer is not as complicated as most people would think.

In this session, we will explore real world scenarios where SignalR excels.  What are good practices for scaling?  How do I handle authentication?  Is SignalR only good for web applications?  All these questions and more will be answered to give you a more complete picture of how SignalR is used in the real world.
