# Beyond Chat: Real World SignalR

Every. Single. SignalR. Demo. Is. A. Chat. Application.

And that is not a good thing for the platform, because SignalR is far more powerful than our simple demos lead us to believe.  The most common question in intro-level SignalR sessions is "How does this apply in a real world application?"  That is a fantastic question, and the answer is not as complicated as most people would think.

In this session, we will explore real world scenarios where SignalR excels.  Additionally, we will cover production concerns with SignalR such as authentication and scaling.
