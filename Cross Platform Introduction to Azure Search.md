# A Cross Platform Introduction to Azure Search

Do you store copious amounts of data that needs to be readily search-able at any moment?  Do you have SELECT statements with a combination of LIKE clauses spread throughout it?  Do you hear the term "aggregation" and shutter at the thought of the JOINs you will have to perform in order to pull out the data you need?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, your application is the perfect candidate for a search solution.  Many off-the-shelf solutions are available, but if you are an Microsoft Azure user, there is an amazing search appliance built in.  Via its easy to use RESTful interface, you can quickly add or enhance the search capabilities of your application.  

This presentation will guide attendees through the problems solved by a search solution versus traditional database services, and show them how to quickly configure Azure Search to be their new solution.

Attendees will learn:
- The differences between search in relational databases and a specialized search appliance, such as Azure Search 
- How to setup and configure Azure Search
- How to add data into Azure Search
- How to retrieve search results and aggregation results via Azure Search's RESTful API
