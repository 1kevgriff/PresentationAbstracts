# Extreme Productivity

## Abstract
Have you ever got into work at 9 am, sat down and all of a sudden it is two in the afternoon?  Where in the heck did the entire day go?  Do you feel like you are constantly managing the expectations of others instead of getting your own work done?  Do you feel the urge to work late or into the evenings just to make up for a lost day?

These feelings are common and totally preventable.  In this presentation, we will discuss five tips for how to reduce the noise and push you forward towards extreme productivity.
