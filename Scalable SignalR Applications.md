#Scalable SignalR Applications

All great SignalR demos and presentations show you how easy it is to build an application
where server and client communication can happen in real-time.  What they never show you
is how to handle cases where your SignalR application is running across multiple servers.
In the cloud connected world, our servers can span across one or one million servers.  Out
of box, SignalR is not configured to handle this!  

In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will show you the issues with running SignalR in the cloud
and how to design an infrastrure that will support multiple SignalR instances.
