Escaping Callbacks: Using Promises in JavaScript
================================================

Imagine you have several asynchronous tasks in JavaScript that all depend on a certain flow.  For example, task A need to complete for task B to kick off.  Writing this code can be cumbersome, as it leads us down the road to callback "hell".  Many developers have started turning towards using deferrals (or promises) to manage this workflow and to lower the complexity of their applications.  In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will take you on a tour of the common libraries developers are using to manage promises and to make their lives easier.  Code samples will vary between web applications and node.js, so a basic understanding of JavaScript is all that is required!

Learning Objectives
- Attendees will see how asynchronous tasks have been handled in the past.
- Attendees will learn how the use of promises will prevent them from entering callback "hell".
- Attendees will see promises in action in both web applications and node.js applications.
