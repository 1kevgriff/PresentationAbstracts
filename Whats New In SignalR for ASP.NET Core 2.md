# What's New In SignalR for ASP.NET Core 2

Hey!  That title kinda rhymes doesn't it.  Very many years ago, the good folks on the ASP.NET team released this little library called SignalR, which made it possible to easily do real-time communication between a web server and clients of all kinds (web, mobile, and more).

Then this ASP.NET Core thing popped up, and really screwed up the story for SignalR.  Meaning, you couldn't use SignalR anymore because it wasn't supported.  That is, until last September when SignalR Core 2 dropped into alpha!

In this presentation, attendees will take a whirlwind tour of all the changes between SignalR old and SignalR new!  Hub changes!  TypeScript!  MessagePack!  Binary streaming!  Even if you've never used SignalR before, you're sure to learn something new.
