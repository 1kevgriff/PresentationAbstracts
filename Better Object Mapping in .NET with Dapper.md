Better DB Object Mapping in .NET with Dapper
=========================================
When people talk about using ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) like Entity Framework or nHibernate in their projects, they commonly are only looking for one fundamental feature: the ability to map SQL output to C# object.  Large ORM-based solutions add additional complexity and black-box much of what is happening behind the scenes.

What if there is a smaller, more efficient way to do object mapping without the overhead of an EF?  Dapper to the rescue!  Dapper is a micro-ORM whose core function is to reduce some of the ceremony of talking to a SQL database while leaving you in complete control!

In this session, we'll walk through many of the typical use-cases for Dapper and why you might want to consider it for your current or next project!
