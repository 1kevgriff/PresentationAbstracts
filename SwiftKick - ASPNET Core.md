# Swift Kick in ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET, for over 15 years, has enabled software developers to build robust, enterprise level web applications on top of the .NET Framework.  In 2015, we saw the first major reimagining of what the framework can be.  ASP.NET Core is designed from the ground up to be an open source, cross platform solution.  Whether you are a developer on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you can harness the power of ASP.NET.  

This presentation will provide you with a basic overview of what the working part of ASP.NET Core are, and how we can build a basic web application using old skills with new technology.
