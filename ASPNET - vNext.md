ASP.NET : The vNext Generation
==============================

For the past 15 years, ASP.NET applications have worked pretty much the same way.  In order to
deploy a new application, you need to have IIS up and running with corresponding .NET 
dependencies installed.

Recently at TechEd 2014, the ASP.NET announced the next generation of ASP.NET applications that
remove the dependency on IIS.  We're talking self-hosted ASP.NET projects!  We're talking
ASP.NET projects that run off a thumb drive.  We're talking ASP.NET projects that run on
Mac and Linux.  In this talk, we'll take a look at some of the latest bits to come out of 
Redmond and how your development experience is going to change over the next several years.
