Did you know that the next version of JavaScript (ES6) is right around the corner?  In fact, your browser might currently support several new features that you aren't even aware of!

For example, what if you could write classes or shorthand functions?  How about using string templates without an external library?  Do you use module libraries such as require?  Wouldn't it be nice if that was just built into the language.  ES6 is full of great new features!

In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will guide you through many of the new features of ES6.  Attendees will see a lot of code, and we will discuss scenarios were you can start using these features today!
