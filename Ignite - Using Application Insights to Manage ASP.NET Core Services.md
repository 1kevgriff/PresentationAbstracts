Using Application Insights to Manage ASP.NET Core Services

Application Insights is an application performance service for web developers.  It works across multiple platforms, including .NET, Node.JS, and more.  It is designed to watch your applications at the granular level, and report back everything it sees.  This helps you answer the critically important questions you seek after an application goes into production.  How many requests per second am I answering?  How fast is a response?  What endpoints are throwing errors?  
In this Community Session, we will explore integrating Application Insights into an ASP.NET Core application and how we can leverage its powerful features to ensure we're protecting ourselves from unforeseen events.
