A common question amongst people who are interested in learning node.js is: "Is node.js ready for the enterprise?" As a developer who has implement numerous node.js based solutions, including recently implementations for the US Air Force, I can safely say "YES!". Node.js is quickly becoming a defacto standard for building fast, scalable modular applications.  

In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will guide you through the development process for node.js applications. We will look at architectures and how various pieces fit together, including examples from live production instances. Developers in this session will talk away with an understanding of how node.js applications work, and how they can be used to replace or supplement existing pieces of their infrastructure.
