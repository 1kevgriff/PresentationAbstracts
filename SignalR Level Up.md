#SignalR Level Up

We've all seen the 100-level SignalR talks.  You know what I'm talking about: a chat application that shows you the basics of Hubs and how to communicate with clients in a realtime environment.  That's awesome, but it's a fraction of the knowledge that's necessary to be productive in SignalR in a production environment.

This session is called SignalR Level Up because I want to take you beyond the basics, and show you how to secure, scale, and grow your SignalR applications.  Even if you haven't played with SignalR in the past, you'll be sure to learn how easy to use this library is.
